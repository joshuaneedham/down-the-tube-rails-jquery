# DownTheTu.be - Tracking your shots fired the easy way!

DownTheTu.be is a Ruby on Rails application that allows a user to create a profile by utilizing Facebook Login. Once a profile is created the user can add any number of firearms, associate any number of barrels with each firearm, and log the number of shots fired via outings.

When creating a firearm a user can add a barrel to the firearm and start with an initial round count for that specific barrel. After the firearm is created additional barrels can be added to the firearm.

To continue tracking a barrels round count outings can be created which allow a user to indicate what the outing type was, for example going to the range, hunting, or a competion/match. Once an outing is saved it increases the total round count, and adds an outing to the list for that particular firearm.

In the future I plan on incorporating the ability to include images of targets, match scores, or images of game taken.

Thanks for checking out the app and may your shots be straight and your aim true.
